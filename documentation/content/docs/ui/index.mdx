Styled components with sensible defaults. Each component handles focus, keybindings, and rendering automatically.

For components where rendering genuinely varies, a `render` prop gives full control over the visual output. The terminal's styling surface area is small enough that props cover the vast majority of customization needs.

## Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Command Palette](/ui/command-palette) | Fuzzy-searchable list of all registered commands |
| [TextInput](/ui/text-input) | Single-line text input with cursor navigation |
