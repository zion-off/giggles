## GigglesProvider

All giggles applications must be wrapped in `GigglesProvider`. This root provider combines the focus and input systems, setting up the necessary context for your entire application.

```tsx title="Basic Setup"
import { render } from 'ink';
import { GigglesProvider } from 'giggles';

render(
  <GigglesProvider>
    <App />
  </GigglesProvider>
);
```

Without this provider, none of the focus or input features will work.

## Focus System

giggles manages focus as a **tree structure**. Components can be focusable, and `FocusGroup` creates navigable lists. Focus moves through the tree based on your layout.

- **FocusGroup**: Container for navigable items (horizontal or vertical)
- **useFocus()**: Hook to access focus state and methods
- **useFocusState()**: Observer hook for focus changes

## Input Handling

Input events flow through the focus tree. The focused component receives input first, then it bubbles up the tree until handled.

- **useKeybindings()**: Bind keys to actions for a component
- **FocusTrap**: Contain input within a section (for modals, dialogs)
- **Key normalization**: `ctrl+c`, `Ctrl-C`, `^c` all work the same
