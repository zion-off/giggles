## giggles

This project uses giggles — a batteries-included React/Ink framework for terminal UIs. It provides focus management, keyboard input routing, screen navigation, and theming on top of Ink (React for CLIs).

Full documentation is available at https://giggles.zzzzion.com. An index of all pages is available at https://giggles.zzzzion.com/llms.txt — fetch this to discover specific pages before searching for information.

### Setup

Every app wraps with `GigglesProvider`. Never call focus hooks in the same component as the provider — put them in a child component.

```tsx
import { render } from 'ink';
import { GigglesProvider } from 'giggles';

function Root() {
  return (
    <GigglesProvider>
      <App />
    </GigglesProvider>
  );
}

render(<Root />);
```

### Focus primitives

**`useFocusNode(options?)`** — registers a leaf node in the focus tree. Returns `{ id, hasFocus }`. Used directly in custom interactive components. Accepts `focusKey` so the parent scope can address this node via `focusChild`/`focusChildShallow`.

**`useFocusScope(options?)`** — registers a scope node. Returns `{ id, hasFocus, isPassive, next, prev, nextShallow, prevShallow, escape, drillIn, focusChild, focusChildShallow }`.
- `hasFocus` is true when the scope node **or any descendant** has focus (ancestor walk, not strict equality).
- Wrap children in `<FocusScope handle={scope}>` to set the implicit parent for nested hooks. Omitting `<FocusScope>` throws a `GigglesError`.
- `keybindings` accepts a plain object or a factory `(helpers) => object`. Handlers are re-registered every render so closures are never stale.
- `focusKey` — optional string that lets the parent scope address this scope by name via `focusChild`/`focusChildShallow`.

**Navigation helpers** — available directly on the handle and as the `keybindings` factory argument. Stable references; safe to call from effects and event handlers.
```ts
next()                  // move to next child, drill into its first leaf
prev()                  // move to prev child, drill into its first leaf
nextShallow()           // move to next child, land on scope node (don't drill)
prevShallow()           // move to prev child, land on scope node
escape()                // make this scope passive — yields input to parent
drillIn()               // focusFirstChild — queues focus if no children yet; first child to register claims it
focusChild(key)         // focus the direct child registered with focusKey=key, drilling into its first leaf
focusChildShallow(key)  // same, but land on the scope node without drilling
```

### Controlled focus

Use `focusKey` to give a child a stable name, then call `focusChild` from the parent to jump directly to it — bypassing `next`/`prev` iteration. Keys are scoped to the immediate parent scope.

```tsx
// Child declares its key
const scope = useFocusScope({ focusKey: 'editor' });
// or on a UI component:
<TextInput focusKey="search" />

// Parent jumps to it directly
const root = useFocusScope({
  keybindings: ({ focusChild }) => ({
    '1': () => focusChild('files'),
    '2': () => focusChild('editor'),
  })
});

// Also available on the handle for effects
useEffect(() => {
  if (error) root.focusChild('errors');
}, [error]);
```

`focusChild` drills into the first leaf of the target (same as `next`). Use `focusChildShallow` to land on the scope node itself. If the key is not found, both are no-ops. If the target scope has no children yet, `focusChild` queues focus — the first child to register claims it automatically.

### Key bubbling

Keys walk from the focused node up to the root. At each node:
1. Skip if passive.
2. If a binding matches, call it and **stop** — no further bubbling.
3. If this is the trap node, stop.

**Implication for composition:** keys not handled by a UI component bubble to the parent scope. A vertical `Select` consumes `j`/`k`/`↑`/`↓`/`enter` — everything else (e.g. `h`, `l`, `e`) bubbles freely. You only need `escape()` when the same key must serve both an inner and outer scope simultaneously.

### `next` vs `nextShallow`

Use `nextShallow`/`prevShallow` at a scope that contains children which may have no registered descendants (e.g. collapsed tree nodes). `next` drills into children — if a child scope has no registered descendants, it will queue indefinitely. `nextShallow` lands on the scope node itself, where the user can press a key to open it.

### Passive mode

Call `escape()` to make a scope passive. The scope node receives focus and is skipped during dispatch, so parent bindings fire instead. Passive clears automatically when focus leaves the scope's subtree.

Only use passive mode when parent and child scopes compete for the **same keys**. If different keys are used at each level, normal bubbling separates them — no `escape()` needed.

### Border color convention

```tsx
<Box borderColor={scope.isPassive ? 'yellow' : scope.hasFocus ? 'green' : 'grey'}>
```

### UI components (`giggles/ui`)

All interactive components use `useFocusNode()` internally — they are leaf nodes, not scopes. Their keybindings fire before bubbling to any parent scope. All interactive components accept a `focusKey` prop so their parent scope can address them via `focusChild`/`focusChildShallow`.

Available components: `Select`, `MultiSelect`, `TextInput`, `Autocomplete`, `Confirm`, `Viewport`, `Modal`, `Badge`, `Spinner`, `Paginator`, `Panel`, `Markdown`, `VirtualList`, `CommandPalette`, `CodeBlock`.

Key behaviour for interactive components:

| Component | Keys consumed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Select` (vertical) | `j` `k` `↑` `↓` `enter` | All other keys bubble |
| `Select` (horizontal) | `h` `l` `←` `→` `enter` | All other keys bubble |
| `MultiSelect` (vertical) | `j` `k` `↑` `↓` `space`; `enter` if `onSubmit` set | |
| `TextInput` | All printable, `←` `→` `home` `end` `backspace` `delete` `enter` | Passthroughs: `tab` `shift+tab` `escape` |
| `Autocomplete` | All printable, `←` `→` `home` `end` `backspace` `delete` `enter` | Passthroughs: `tab` `shift+tab` `escape` |
| `Confirm` | `y` `n` `enter` | |
| `Viewport` | `j` `k` `↑` `↓` `pageup` `pagedown` `g` `G` | |
| `Modal` | — | Wraps `FocusTrap`; `escape` closes |

`Select` and `MultiSelect` work in controlled or uncontrolled mode. Pass `value`/`onChange` to own state yourself; omit them to let the component manage it internally. Use `onHighlight` to observe cursor movement without owning state.

### `useKeybindings`

Register keybindings independently from focus scope navigation. You can call it multiple times in the same component — all bindings are active simultaneously, later calls override earlier ones for duplicate keys.

```tsx
// Base navigation
useKeybindings(focus, { j: moveDown, k: moveUp });

// Search mode — fallback intercepts unbound keys; escape bubbles to named bindings above
useKeybindings(focus, searchMode ? { escape: exitSearch } : {}, searchMode ? { fallback: handleInput, bubble: ['escape'] } : undefined);
```

**Fallback handler:** pass `fallback` to catch keys that don't match any named binding — useful for text input. Keys listed in `bubble` skip the fallback and propagate to parent scopes. `TextInput` and `Autocomplete` use this internally.

**App-wide shortcuts:** register them on the root scope — unhandled keys bubble up naturally, so a binding at the root fires whenever no child consumes the key first.

### `FocusTrap`

Locks input to a subtree — nothing outside it receives keys until the trap unmounts. Used internally by `Modal`. Use it directly for custom modal-like components.

### Screen router

```ts
const { push, pop, replace, reset, currentRoute } = useNavigation();

push('screenName', params)    // open on top of stack
pop()                         // return to previous screen
replace('screenName', params) // swap current screen
reset('screenName', params)   // clear stack, show this screen
```

All screens stay mounted but hidden — state is preserved across navigation. Focus position is saved on push and restored on pop. Use `restoreFocus={false}` on `<Screen>` to always focus the first child instead.

### Theme

Access the active theme with `useTheme()`. Override values by passing a `theme` prop to `GigglesProvider`:

```tsx
<GigglesProvider theme={{ borderColor: 'cyan', borderStyle: 'round' }}>
```

### Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Focus hooks in the same component as `GigglesProvider` | Move them into a child component |
| `useFocusScope()` without a corresponding `<FocusScope>` | Throws `GigglesError` — always render `<FocusScope handle={scope}>` wrapping the children |
| `next()` hangs on a scope with no registered children | Use `nextShallow()` at the parent level |
| `h`/`l` bubbling unexpectedly to parent scope | Vertical `Select` does not consume `h`/`l` — use different keys at each level, or use `escape()` if the same keys must serve both |
| Parent bindings not firing while child is focused | Expected — add `escape()` to the child scope to yield control |
