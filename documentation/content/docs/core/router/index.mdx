import { Terminal } from '@/components/terminal';
import BasicRouterExample from '@/components/examples/router/basic-router';

## Quick start

```tsx title="Basic router"
import { GigglesProvider, Router, Screen, useNavigation, useFocusNode, useKeybindings } from 'giggles';

function App() {
  return (
    <GigglesProvider>
      <Router initialScreen="home">
        <Screen name="home" component={Home} />
        <Screen name="settings" component={Settings} />
      </Router>
    </GigglesProvider>
  );
}

function Home() {
  const { push } = useNavigation();
  const focus = useFocusNode();

  useKeybindings(focus, {
    s: () => push('settings'),
  });

  return <Text>Home <Text dimColor>Press s for settings</Text></Text>;
}

function Settings() {
  const { pop, canGoBack } = useNavigation();
  const focus = useFocusNode();

  useKeybindings(focus, {
    q: () => pop(),
  });

  return <Text>Settings {canGoBack && <Text dimColor>Press q to go back</Text>}</Text>;
}
```

<Terminal>
  <BasicRouterExample />
</Terminal>

## How the stack works

`Router` maintains a stack of screens. Only the top screen is visible — but every screen below it stays mounted, preserving its state. Navigating back is instant: there's no re-initialization, no lost scroll position, no refetched data.

The four stack operations map directly to what you'd expect:

- `push(name, params)` — add a screen on top
- `pop()` — remove the top screen, return to the previous one
- `replace(name, params)` — swap the current screen without adding to the stack
- `reset(name, params)` — clear the stack and start fresh from a single screen

Call these from `useNavigation()` inside any screen component.

## Focus integration

When a screen becomes the top of the stack, its first focusable child receives focus automatically. When navigating back, focus is restored to whichever element was focused before the screen was covered — so the user's position is preserved across navigation.

To always focus the first child on return instead, set `restoreFocus={false}` on the `Router`.
