# giggles

build terminal apps the way you build web apps — with react, hooks, and jsx.

giggles sits on top of [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and handles focus, keyboard input, and screen navigation so you don't have to. declare your screens, bind your keys, and let the framework do the wiring.
